Key Training Process Findings:
=============================

1. Convergence Patterns:
   • Single components show faster initial convergence but higher overfitting
   • Complex combinations show slower but more stable convergence
   • Temporal Attention shows rapid learning but severe overfitting (>50% gap)

2. Overfitting Analysis:
   • Temporal Attention Only: Highest overfitting (50.30% gap)
   • Feature Selection + Attention: High overfitting (52.34% gap)
   • Correlation + Attention: Low overfitting (11.05% gap)
   • Full HybridNet: Moderate overfitting (11.91% gap)

3. Training Stability:
   • Simpler models show more training instability
   • Complex combinations provide implicit regularization
   • Correlation-based models show more consistent validation curves

4. Performance Patterns:
   • Single components achieve highest individual performance
   • Component combinations often show negative interactions
   • Full model integration leads to performance degradation

Recommendations:
===============
• Focus on Temporal Attention component with better regularization
• Investigate negative interactions between Feature Selection and Correlation components
• Consider simpler architectures for better performance
• Implement stronger overfitting prevention for attention-based models
