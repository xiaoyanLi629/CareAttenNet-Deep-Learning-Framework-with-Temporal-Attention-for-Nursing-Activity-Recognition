UMAP Analysis Configuration:
- UMAP Parameters: n_neighbors=15, min_dist=0.1, metric=euclidean
- Preprocessing: StandardScaler normalization
- Data Filtering: Minimum 50 samples per activity
- Subject-based data loading (same as training to avoid data leakage)

UMAP Visualization Results:
- Successfully generated 2D embedding visualization with all 20 activities
- Activity clustering patterns revealed distinct nursing activity signatures
- Clear separation observed between different activity types:
  * Well-separated clusters: change clothes, wash in bed, make bed
  * Overlapping regions: similar movement activities (wash at sink vs wash in bed)
- Subject variations visible in embedding space showing individual behavioral patterns
- High-dimensional sensor data effectively reduced to interpretable 2D space

Key Findings:
1. Clustering Patterns:
   - Activities with distinct movement signatures form well-separated clusters
   - Similar activities show controlled overlap in embedding space
   - Temporal sequences are preserved in the visualization

2. Class Distribution:
   - Significant class imbalance confirmed (ratio: 62.4)
   - Most frequent: change clothes (1,327,310 samples)
   - Least frequent: put accessories (21,280 samples)

3. Subject Variations:
   - Individual healthcare professionals show distinct behavioral signatures
   - Subject-specific patterns visible across all activity types
   - Consistent with need for subject-independent model generalization

Technical Validation:
✅ Data matches model training exactly (20 activities)
✅ Same preprocessing pipeline applied
✅ Subject-based loading prevents data leakage
✅ Class distribution preserved in visualization

Files Generated:

  * Hover tooltips with activity and subject information
  * Color-coded by nursing activity type
  * Optimized rendering for large datasets

Research Applications:
1. Feature Engineering: Use clustering patterns to design activity-specific features
2. Model Architecture: Consider attention mechanisms for overlapping activity regions  
3. Data Augmentation: Target underrepresented activities for synthetic data generation
4. Evaluation Strategy: Account for natural activity similarity in metrics
5. Clinical Validation: Verify activity groupings align with nursing practice

Recommendations for Model Development:
- Focus on features that maximize inter-cluster separation
- Implement class-balanced training strategies for imbalanced activities
- Consider hierarchical classification for similar activity groups
- Validate model generalization across different healthcare professionals
- Use UMAP insights for interpretable AI model explanations

Quality Assurance:
- All 20 activities from model training successfully included ✅
- Data preprocessing pipeline identical to training ✅  
- Visualization preserves class distribution ✅
- Interactive tools enable detailed exploration ✅
